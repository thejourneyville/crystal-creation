<h1>CRYSTAL CREATION</h1>
<i>randomized movement of n nodes mirrored on x/y axis to create symmetry</i>

A visualization of nodes moving to random positions, duplicated on the horizontal/vertical axis to create the
illusion of symmetry (ie: crystal) All nodes are connected to each other by a line. All possible combinations
of connectivity are found through Python's built in itertools permutations

using n / 2 nodes, nodes into a random position which moves the 'twin
of the node (x/y -> -x/-y) in the mirror opposite direction on both x and y
